<p>When I first opened the BrowserHistory1 Instructions, I saw that there are only 7 steps. I thought to myself, this doesn’t seem complicated, so I tried the WOD by myself without any help just to test my knowledge and to see if I understand what I should do. Overall, I do get it but I had a difficult time with steps 5 and 6 which is creating one link within each section to an external web page and creating an itemized list with links. And so I watched the screencast for help while watching the screencast I notice that I missed adding a few tags such as the paragraph tag. Rather than having two paragraphs, I had only one. I took notes on the things I made mistake then I tried again. I forgot the time myself on the first try. However, on my second try, I was able to operate the web page successfully and my time was 20 minutes which is considered the average time.</p>
<p>For BrowserHistory2 and BrowserHistory3, I did the same thing as BrowserHistory1, where I tried it by myself first when I watched the screencast when I got stuck and kept trying till I get it and understand what to do. For browserHistory2 my time was 20 minutes and for BrowserHistory3 15 minutes. I tried multiple times for BrowserHistory3 because I needed to get more familiar with CSS.</p>
<p>My advice is to try the WODs by yourself first to test your knowledge with the material than watch the screencast and take notes on the things you made mistakes on. After that, try again and when you're stuck just go watch the screencast or even google it. Then when you’re finally confident that you get it, try to improve your time. Depending on how difficult the WODs are by your second try or third and so on, you would most likely get it and understand what you are doing and able to realize what mistakes you keep making and fix it.</p>
