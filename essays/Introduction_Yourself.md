Hey guys! 
My name is Shelah Marie Cruz. This is my third year in college and I’m majoring in Finance and MIS. I’m from Olongapo City, Philippines and I moved here when I was 10 years old. 
 
I don’t know anything about programming, this is all new to me, but I’m thrilled to learn and hopefully I will understand what I will be doing in class. The reason why I decided to take ITM 352 because first, it’s a required class and second I’ve always been interested in programming and coding, I got to start from somewhere.
